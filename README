A simulator of random walks using Monte Carlo methods.

To run the program, first create a Python 3 virtual environment
and install the requirements with

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

and then get `tkinter` (`python-tk`, `tk`) with your favourite
package manager.

Then, execute it with

    $ python -m drwalk

and click around. To compile the LaTeX document, `wrapfig` should be installed.
